# Contributing
All contributions are much welcome and greatly appreciated! Expect to be credited for you effort.

## General
Generally try to limit the scope of any Pull Request to an atomic update if possible. This way, it's much easier to assess and review your changes.

You should expect a considerably faster turn around if you submit two or more PRs instead of baking them all into one major PR.
